From 2012 to 2016, she was a member of the 5H and her leaving was the beginning of the end of the group, but also the start of her journey to become one of the most important singers of her generation.</p>
                    <p>Being free to fly solo, Camila gave us more artistic freedom and concept by using latin beats and rhythms, exalting her homeland culture. Her first solo smash hit Havana had spanish words and latin-inspired beat, paying tribute to the capital of her home country, Cuba. Since 2016, when the solo career started, Camila had several smash hits and powerful collaborations like Señorita with Shawn Mendes, besides many nominations and award winnings.</p>

All of them have concept and meaningful lyrics, talking about how she got throw the alcoholism, drug addiction and the death of loved ones.

She is the newest of the pop divas, but some of her achievements are bigger than usual.
